# ADR Index

Architecture Decision Records for Human OS, grouped by family. Regenerate the table data after adding an ADR — every ADR file should carry a `## Status` section so this index can classify it.

**Status legend:**

- **Accepted** — decided and (where applicable) implemented,
- **Accepted direction** — decided as direction, not yet implemented in the engine,
- **Informational** — records context or provenance; not an implementable decision.
